# UFO-sightings: Project overview<br>
- Cleaned UFO sighting data from 1910-2013  
- Performed exploratory data analysis  
- Created Tableau dashboard for visualization of data  

---

## Code and Resources Used<br>

---

**Python Version**: 3.7  
**Packages**: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
**Data Set**: https://www.kaggle.com/NUFORC/ufo-sightings

 ## Data Cleaning<br>
 
 After data was acquired, it needed to be cleaned for analysis:
 
 - Checked for and removed null data
 - Changed date columns to date time format
 - Changed duration column to float data type

---

## EDA<br>

Basic analysis of the data, finding the state and year with the most sightings, and the most common shape.

## Analysis<br>

From working with this data a few conclusions can be drawn from the data. First, the USA has the most sightings by far of any of country in the data set.
This could be due to the popularity of Area 51, although New Mexico is far lower in sightings than one would think. One could also argue that due to Area 51, there is
a cultural interest in extraterritorials and paranormal activities. The major difference could also be due to a possible lack of ability to report in other countries,
depending on how the data was gathered.<br>

The second interesting find in this data is in the shape of the sightings, with light as the most popular shape. The second most popular is the combined unknown/other shape.
This could be due to the length of time between the sightings, and reporting them, or could be due to the witness being under the influence of alcohol or drugs, causing them
to not be able to properly categorize the shape.<br>

Finally, in the visualization, we see that most of the sightings are short, with the majority of them less than 200 seconds, or 3 minutes. With shorter durations,
this could also add to the difficulty of properly seeing and describing the shape of the sighting.
